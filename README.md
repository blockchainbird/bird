## What is _bird_?
A toolset and software to build a decentralised, trustless, and easy to use extra layer of guarantee on top of existing database systems.

## Who is _bird_ for?
Any group of individuals and organisations. It's free to use and to adapt to your own needs.

## Why do we need _bird_?
95%+ of the projects labeled as blockchain are pointless. Nearly all projects are just database-implementations, covered in marketing mist around the blockchain hype.

## How does _bird_ do the job?
_bird_ sticks to the design principles of bitcoin and implements the building blocks needed to create an uncensorable open public blockchain application. When consistently done right, that process results in the _extra layer of guarantee_ your world has never seen before.

### More details

A **Trust Network** is any group of individuals and organisations that do not want to trust each other or a third party any more.

What does _bird_ do for a Trust Network?: It looks for mistrust. Mistrust is good*.
* If you trust the situation, use a database to improve and innovate. And forget about blockchain.

Why are we looking for mistrust? Because eliminating the trust factor is a _unique feature_ of open, public, distributed, censorship-free blockchains.

The vast majority of other blockchains (private, permissioned, closed sourced, KYC'd, AML'd, etc) are pointless. Use _bird_ to be on the right side of history.

 We eat our own dogfood. 
 _Bird_ is:
 - open source
 - public
 - free
 - self-sovereign
 - uncensorable
 - borderless
 - and has no obligations to financial sponsors
